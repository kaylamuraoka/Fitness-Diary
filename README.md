## Credits

Majority of the application's front end code was provided on behalf of UC Berkeley as part of their full stack web development bootcamp curriculum. I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema, handled routes with Express, connected the front-end and back-end, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku.
